May. 2022 – Present <br/>
Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Dept. of Electronic and Information Engineering <br/>
**Ongoing project**: Cyber-Physical System and Reinforcement Learning-Enabled Autonomous Driving Behavior
Connected and Autonomous Driving System
> * Built a digital twins-based driving simulation platform that connects a physical driving device (i.e., hardware) with a virtual driving environment (i.e., software).

Dec. 2020 – Nov. 2022 <br/>
University of California, Berkeley, Dept. of Transportation Engineering & Beijing Jiaotong University, Dept. of Transportation Engineering <br/>
**Project**: Game Theoretical Analysis for a Two-city Economic System
> * Designed a system composed of two ring-radial cities connected by a high-speed rail with changing congestion
> * Derived the Nash Equilibrium (NE) state of people’s work and commute pattern distributions

Dec. 2021 – May. 2022	 <br/>
Beijing Jiaotong University, Dept. of Transportation Engineering <br/>
**Project**: Individual Particulate Matter Exposure for Urban Commuters
> * Collected inhaled PM2.5 per second with a portable monitor under different travel modes (over 100 hours)
> * Quantified the relationship between inhaled PM2.5 and external factors (e.g., gender, age, respiration rate)
> * Quantified impacts of PM2.5 on population mortality rate and disability adjusted life year for different re-gions
> * Built an inhaled PM2.5 prediction model based on travel characteristics and simulated the PM2.5 exposure 
> * Wrote a thesis and obtained Outstanding Undergraduate Graduation Thesis Award (top 5%)

## **Second Prize, 16th National Competition of Transport Science and Technology** <br/>
**Project**: Ventilation Metamaterial Barrier for Traffic Noise Reduction
> * Developed a metamaterial to achieve adequate control of low-frequency mechanical waves and solved the problem of noise pollution on traffic roads 
> * Designed a new split tube resonator of double-sided noise reduction, ventilation, and no reflector 
> * Applied local resonance mechanism to the noise reduction, which combined theories in acoustics, structural mechanics, and road traffic
