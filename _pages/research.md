## *IN* University of California, Berkeley, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering
Research Assistant to *Professor Gabriel Gomes* <br/>
Aug. 2022 – Present <br/>
**Ongoing Project**: Traffic Lights control and path commendation Based on Reinforcement Learning
> * Built a city-scale simulation platform based on simulation of urban mobility (SUMO)
> * Proposed a traffic light control algorithm based on the deep Q-learning network (DQN) and Actor-to-critic (A2C) 
> * Proposed an RL agent using A2C to provide real-time path recommendations to commuters on which travel modes and routes to use
> * Trained two agents with collaborative designs to minimize the generalized system cost under PM2.5 exposure

Research Assistant to *Professor Mark Hansen & Professor Sida Luo* <br/>
Dec. 2020 – Nov. 2022 <br/>
**Project**: Game Theoretical Analysis for a Two-city Economic System
> *	Designed a system composed of two ring-radial cities connected by a high-speed rail with changing congestion
