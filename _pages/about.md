Hi, I’m Xiangyu Li. I’m currently a second-year PhD student in Transportation Systems Analysis and Planning at Northwestern University. I hold a Master’s degree in Transportation Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, and a Bachelor’s degree in Transportation Engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University. My research focuses on autonomous driving, urban mobility, traffic management, and public transportation systems, with a particular interest in advanced applications of deep learning and optimization techniques.
